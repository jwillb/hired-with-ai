# hired-with-ai
An AI-Powered job curator that saves and sends jobs from LinkedIn via ntfy.

## Introduction
I found the job search process to be tedious and time-consuming, so I devised a way to have it done automatically.
## Requirements
To use this program, you must install Python, and `pip`. Then, you must install the requirements (TODO: add requirements.txt)
## Usage
After this is done, copy the `sample-env` file and rename it to `.env`. Then, set all of the environment variables to your liking (TODO: add environment variable for multiple LLM API URLs).
Then, run `main.py`. In the future, there will be a Docker container to aid in deployment.
